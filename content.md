You should be in your home directory, which you can find in the variable $HOME:
```terminal
echo "$HOME"
```
You can find the current directory with either the pwd command or the PWD variable:
```terminal
pwd
echo "$PWD"
```
If you are not in your home directory, you can get there by typing cd and pressing Enter at the shell
prompt.
